# Disaster Management System

A software application to the responsible authorities to make the procedure easier, more efficient, accurate and faster by avoiding the problems that arise in the four phases of disaster management. 

The fundamental target of this proposed project idea is to implement a method to ensure an effective information system that can provide timely access to comprehensive, relevant and reliable information at the time of a disaster.

The proposed system provides interfaces for GN between the Divisional secretariat and DMC. This is to be achieved by maintaining a database by GN about the general public in hazardous risk areas & maintaining a mapped database of safe houses. Through this system, GN could be able to inform the general public about disaster management awareness programs organized by top responsible authorities by sending text messages. The divisional secretariat office is maintaining an inventory that consists of equipment such as generators, tents, boats. The Divisional Secretariat has assigned a responsible person to manage the inventory properly at the time of disaster. DMC issues disaster warning notices through the proposed system to divisional secretariats and GN by a pop-up notification. Grama niladhari sends disaster warning alerts via SMS to the people in the affected areas & assigning them to previously identified safety houses. The Divisional Secretariat has assigned an officer to manage the safe house properly at the time of disaster. The responsible person in charge of the safe house updates the system with details of victims. According to the information provided by the responsible person in charge of the safe house, disaster relief management activities are progressing. The system facilitates the exchange of surplus equipment from nearby divisional secretariatâ€™s inventories when there is insufficient equipment for safe houses in disaster relief. The system facilitates providing accurate information on food, drink and essential equipment needed by the victims to provide relief to voluntary organizations through a dashboard. Statistical reports are approved by the District Secretariat through the system. The system facilitates the systematic processing of compensation and generating statistical reports.
